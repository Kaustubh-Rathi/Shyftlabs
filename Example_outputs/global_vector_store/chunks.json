One of the key elements in timekeeping is the calculation of days in a year, a topic that has been intricately linked to the development of calendar systems. The Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, stands as a pivotal milestone in calendar history, aiming to rectify the inaccuracies of its predecessor, the Julian calendar. This research delves into the structure and calculation of days in a year according to the Gregorian calendar, exploring its historical context, leap year rules, and alignment with astronomical cycles.
